                <h2> Our Humble Beginnings  </h2>
                <p> In the early 2010s, Sairam, inspired by a void he noticed between football and food experiences, embarked on a journey with his close group of football friends from university to bridge this gap. Fueled by a shared passion for the beautiful game and a desire to enhance the overall football-watching experience, they founded our company. From those humble beginnings, we've grown into a dynamic team dedicated to bringing innovation and joy to the intersection of sports and cuisine. </p>
