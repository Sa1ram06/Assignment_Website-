## Project Overview

A place where the thrill for football collides with the joy of exquisite dining. Our goal is to forge a fusion between the passion for football and love for delightful food. Users not only enjoy the football match but also celebrate every goal and victory with delicacies.

## Design Process

As passionate football fans, we've always craved a celebration with exceptional food during matches. Seeing the absence of a connection between enjoying a football match and having quality food at the same place, I created KicknCuisine. This website brings the love for food and football together, providing a unique experience for the target audience.

## Target Audience

1. **Football Enthusiast:** Avid fans with a strong passion for the sport.
2. **Foodies:** Enjoy a wide range of cuisines while immersing in the excitement of the game.
3. **Event Organizers:** Catering to various needs for private-viewing parties, corporate gatherings, etc.

## Our Services

### 1. Ordering Food

Providing both on-site and online ordering, our menu goes beyond local delights, offering dishes inspired by various cuisines. Delicate food options enhance the celebration during football matches.

### 2. Booking Room/Event Hall

Various types of rooms/halls cater to user needs, from private rooms for enjoying delicate food and entertaining football matches to halls for hosting big events.

#### Special Spaces:
1. **FanZone:** An open space for users to come together, celebrate their favorite team, and transform each match into a memory.
2. **Football Suits:** Cozy rooms with delicate food for users who want to celebrate football matches with close companions.
3. **Big Halls:** Ideal for companies or businesses hosting gatherings or team bonding sessions.
