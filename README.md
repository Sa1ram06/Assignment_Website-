Project Name: KicknCuisin22e
Overview: 
A place where the thrill for football collides with the joy of exquisite dining. Our goal is to forge a fusion between the passion for football and love for delightful food. Taking inspiration from karaoke, users go beyond just enjoying the football match but also celebrating every goal and victory with delicacies.
The Gap to Overcome:
From a perspective of passionate football fan, we always been craving for football celebration with exceptional food. However, it is disheartening to see the absence of connection between the enjoyment in watching football match and availability of quality food at the same place. In most circumstance, the service is focused on serving delightful dining experience or environment to the watch the football match. Thus, I took this opportunity to respond to this gap by creating a website where it brings the love for food and football together and ultimately, providing the target audience an experience they have been craving for. 
Purpose: 
My aim is to fill the gap between watching football match and the availability of quality food. With this KicknCuisine website, users are able to experience a unique fusion where they are able to book rooms to watch the football match, order food from diverse menu or even organise an event. By these services, I hope to tie a bond between food and football, elevating the passion for football.
